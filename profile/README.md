## About @Hack CTF

[@Hack (also spelled AtHack)](https://athackctf.com/) is a cybersecurity CTF (Capture The Flag) competition organized 
by Concordia Universityâ€™s [Hexploit Alliance](https://hexploit-alliance.com) and [TECHNATION](https://technationcanada.ca/en/).

It challenges participants to solve security puzzles in areas like cryptography, web exploitation, and reverse
engineering. Open to all skill levels, it promotes hands-on learning and skill development through team-based flag-capturing puzzles.
